### DemoApplication

When testing before the actual lecture, this was what I came up with
Very basic overview of using the Design tool for UI and connecting some basic lifecycle methods

### LiveDemoApplication

Where I will init an application during lecture to demonstrate how quick it is to get things working, at least at a
basic level

### ToolkitApplication

Pre-made application to showcase some of the cool builtin UI elements Android has to offer. NOT Comprehensive, but (I
think) a good jumping off point
